## Node.js Microservices Example

This repository contains an example implementation of a microservices architecture using Node.js. The example demonstrates how to create and communicate between multiple microservices within a distributed system.

### Overview

The project consists of several microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality. These microservices communicate with each other through APIs and are designed to be scalable, resilient, and independent of each other.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js used for building APIs and web applications.
- **axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to other services.
- **cors:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware for Express.js to allow requests from other domains.
- **nodemon:** A utility to monitor for changes in your Node.js application and automatically restart the server.
- **Skaffold:** A command-line tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications. Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying applications in Kubernetes.

### Deployment with Skaffold

To deploy the microservices using Skaffold, follow these basic instructions:

1. Install Skaffold by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/).

2. Ensure that you have a Kubernetes cluster configured and accessible from your local environment.

3. Navigate to the root directory of the project where the Skaffold configuration file (`skaffold.yaml`) is located.

4. Run the following command to deploy the microservices to your Kubernetes cluster:


This command will build and deploy the microservices defined in the `skaffold.yaml` file to your Kubernetes cluster. Skaffold will automatically watch for changes in your code and redeploy the microservices as needed.

### Future Improvements

- Implement health checks and monitoring for each microservice.
- Introduce service discovery and load balancing.
- Enhance error handling and resilience strategies.
- Add authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
