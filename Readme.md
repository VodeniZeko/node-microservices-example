## Node.js Microservices Example

This repository contains an example implementation of a microservices architecture using Node.js. The example demonstrates how to create and communicate between multiple microservices within a distributed system.

### Overview

The project consists of several microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality. These microservices communicate with each other through APIs and are designed to be scalable, resilient, and independent of each other.

### Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Express.js
