## Node.js Microservices Example

This repository contains an example implementation of a microservices architecture using Node.js. The example demonstrates how to create and communicate between multiple microservices within a distributed system.

### Overview

The project consists of several microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality. These microservices communicate with each other through APIs and are designed to be scalable, resilient, and independent of each other.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js used for building APIs and web applications.
- **axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to other services.
- **cors:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware for Express.js to allow requests from other domains.
- **nodemon:** A utility to monitor for changes in your Node.js application and automatically restart the server.

### Deployment

Each microservice is Dockerized and deployed in a Kubernetes cluster for easy management and scalability.

### Future Improvements

- Implement health checks and monitoring for each microservice.
- Introduce service discovery and load balancing.
- Enhance error handling and resilience strategies.
- Add authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
